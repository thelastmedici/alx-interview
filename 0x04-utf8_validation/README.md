## Description
In this project, we are tasked with implementing a function `utf8_validation` that takes an array of integers as input and checks if it represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The function should return `1` if the encoding is valid, and `0` otherwise.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-0x04-utf8-validation.git
    ```

2. Compile the code:
    ```
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o utf8_validation
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```
    ./utf8_validation
    ```
